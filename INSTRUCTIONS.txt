FIRST TIME ONLY:
Edit the CertRequestGenerator.ps1 to include your cert's Company name, City, State, Country, and department.

All certs must exist on the IIS Server first, this tool only helpes with renewing certs and rebinding on IIS.

If you don't have any certs, you can use the SingleRequestGenerator.ps1 to generate the requests, once imported you'll need to manually bind any site's https to the cert one time.

-----------------------
ALL OTHER TIMES:

Run CertRequestGenerator.ps1 to generate the requests, zip up any that you wish and send for fulfillment.

Once the responses from the SSL Cert provider are gathered, put them in the Responses folder, and rename them to the following format:
domain.name.crt

(ex: direct.mysite.us.crt)

Then run the CertImporter.ps1 which will Import, Fix, Update Bindings, and export for external things like CDNs (see Exported folder)

Once all operations are complete, make sure to delete the old SSL Certs so next time you run the CertRequestGenerator.ps1 it doesn't have duplicates.
